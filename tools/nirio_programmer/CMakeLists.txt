### Set up build environment ##################################################
# Choose a static or shared-library build (shared is default, and static will
# probably need some special care!)
# Set this to ON in order to link a static build of UHD:
option(UHD_USE_STATIC_LIBS OFF)

# To add UHD as a dependency to this project, add a line such as this:
find_package(UHD 3.15.0.0 REQUIRED)
# The version in  ^^^^^  here is a minimum version.
# To specify an exact version:
#find_package(UHD 3.8.1 EXACT REQUIRED)

# This example also requires Boost:
set(UHD_BOOST_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS
    program_options
    system
    thread
    regex
)
set(BOOST_MIN_VERSION "1.58")
include(UHDBoost)

### Configure Compiler ########################################################
include_directories(
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../host/include"
    ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}
    ${UHD_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
link_directories(${Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS})

### Make the executable #######################################################
add_executable(nirio_programmer nirio_programmer.cpp)

set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release")

# Shared library case: All we need to do is link against the library, and
# anything else we need (in this case, some Boost libraries):
if(NOT UHD_USE_STATIC_LIBS)
    message(STATUS "Linking against shared UHD library.")
    target_link_libraries(nirio_programmer ${UHD_LIBRARIES} ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
# Shared library case: All we need to do is link against the library, and
# anything else we need (in this case, some Boost libraries):
else(NOT UHD_USE_STATIC_LIBS)
    message(STATUS "Linking against static UHD library.")
    target_link_libraries(nirio_programmer
        # We could use ${UHD_LIBRARIES}, but linking requires some extra flags,
        # so we use this convenience variable provided to us
        ${UHD_STATIC_LIB_LINK_FLAG}
        # Also, when linking statically, we need to pull in all the deps for
        # UHD as well, because the dependencies don't get resolved automatically
        ${UHD_STATIC_LIB_DEPS}
    )
endif(NOT UHD_USE_STATIC_LIBS)

### Once it's built... ########################################################
# Here, you would have commands to install your program.
# We will skip these in this example.
